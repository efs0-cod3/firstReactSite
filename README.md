## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

A lot...

- First time using react for that reason a simple design was scary at first the was fluent..
- Learning that to import images have to be on the src folder.
- Used var for the css.

### Continued development

Will be implementing my knowledge on react making a little bit more complicated challenges.
